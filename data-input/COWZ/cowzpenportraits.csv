They tend to travel very short distances to work by public transport, bike or on foot."Supergroup	2	Top jobs	#3D76EA	2	20	"This supergroup is characterised by high density and a low OA:WZ ratio (splits), higher than average percentage of young females, high Black, Asian + European ethnicities, high percentages of Level 4 qualifications, high employees, high on ICT, Finance, Prof/Sci/Tech, high on Higher managerial and Lower managerial, low on routine occupations, high on travelling more than 20km to work, low on working from home/no fixed place, low on part time working. This group is mainly found in large numbers in the major metropolitan centres. There are small numbers of isolated WZs in this group in other locations e.g. Science Parks etc."Supergroup	3	Metro suburbs	#9731B5	3	30	"This supergroup is characterised by a higher than average percentage of non-white workers, self-employed workers and workers working from home or with no fixed place of work, together with a higher than average percentage of people using public transport to get to work. Geographically, this supergroup is mostly in large metropolitan areas, particularly those with a significant ethnic population and public transport system. It is particularly obvious in large cities such as London, Manchester and Birmingham and other cities with multicultural populations. In the very large cities where the top jobs supergroup is present, the metro suburbs supergroup is generally found in a ring outside of these top jobs, but is located inside supergroup four (suburban services). In areas which do not have a core of top jobs, the metro suburbs are often found just outside the retail centre of the city, but still inside the suburban services."Supergroup	4	Suburban services	#838383	4	40	"This supergroup is characterised by slightly higher than average white ethnicity, high percentages working from home/no fixed place of work, slightly higher than average Education, Health/social work, Construction and utilities and a low proportion of people travelling more than 20km. It is fairly low density, being characterised by a higher than average proportion of OA of mergers. It is the largest supergroup by number of WZs and is mostly found outside of the metro suburbs and across lower-density urban areas such as the South Wales valleys."Supergroup	5	Manufacturing and distribution	#8A6F3D	5	50	"The manufacturing, transport and distribution supergroup is characterised by a slightly lower than average OA:WZ ratio, low percentage of female workers, low percentage high qualifications, high percentage low qualifications, high employees, low part-time, high manufacturing, Energy/utilities, transport and storage, lower status working, low on working from home and no fixed place of work, slightly high on >20km."Supergroup	6	Rural	#32BE55	6	60	"The Rural supergroup is characterised by a higher than average percentages of older, white, workers who are self-employed (both with and without employees), who work from home or have no fixed place of work. Workplace population density is low. Workers are primarily engaged in Agric/forest/fish, and, to a lesser extent, other sectors such as Mining/quarrying, Manufac, Utilities, Construction and Education. This supergroup is the largest in terms of number of WZs and is found in rural and outer suburban areas throughout England and Wales."Supergroup	7	Servants of society	#FB333D	7	70	"The Servants of Society cluster is characterised by higher than average density, females and young females. It is just below average on non-White and European groups and just above for White. Level 4 qualifications are high, as are employees, while self-employment of any type is low. Both extremes of working hours are low, with part time 16-30 just on the average. The only industrial sectors above average are public administration and defence, education and health. Higher managerial jobs are a little above average, but lower managerial and intermediate status more so. Both extremes of travel distance are above average but working from home and without a fixed place of work are well below. In summary, these tend to be higher status, well-qualified employees in large public service organizations with good female representation in the workforce. They include hospitals, schools and colleges, prisons and government offices and are widely spread nationally, although somewhat clustered in the major service centres."Group	1a	Low density retail and wholesale	#FFEEBB	100	11	"A workforce characterised by above-average levels of White British ethnicity, employees and students, with particularly high levels of part-time working and employment in wholesale and retail trades, semi-routine occupations and short travel to work distances.

The group is very widely dispersed and found primarily in smaller towns."Group	1c	Multicultural urban high streets	#F2CE81	102	13	"This group has high levels of female participaton in a generally younger workforce with high percentages of Black and Asian ethnicities, students and parttime working. Accommodation and food services, financial and insurance activities occur with retail and wholesale as the dominant industries.

It is dominated by the highest status managerial, administrative and professional occupations, with very high percentages travelling more than 20km to work by public transport. It occurs almost exclusively in London, where it is widespread in the City of London and Docklands, with only a very few WZs in the centres of other metropolitan cities."Group	2b	Administrative centres	#93BDE0	107	22	"While the demographic, occupational status and travel to work characteristics of this group are very similar to the high status city commuters, these areas are marked by a very different industrial structure, with public administration and defence being the largest activity. This group is found only in the centres of large cities, but is less concentrated in London than the high status city commuters."Group	2c	Big city life	#6992C0	108	23	"The workforce has a high proportion of non-British workers, with above-average levels of female participation.

Percentages travelling more than 20km are very high and public transport use is above average."Group	3a	Metro suburban distribution	#EBC4FF	111	31	"Above average Black and Asian ethnicities and post-2001 EU accession countries in a workforce which is average in very many dimensions but in which transport and storage is the most prominent industry, wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services are also above average. Scattered across outer suburban areas of major metropolitan centres."Group	3b	Cosmopolitan metro suburban mix	#B67ED6	112	32	"Above average Black and Asian ethnicities and post-2001 EU accession countries in a workforce in which construction, transport and storage, ICT are all above average as is self-employment without employees.
